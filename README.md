An totally anonymous black market price checker  
Inspired by streetRx, but in no way related.

I wanted to go farther and track whatever someone wanted to enter to get a global or at least local for now index of how the market of things not so well tracked. Not for any other reason than to try to add some competition to whatever market that happens to use this site.  

And I want to try my hand at some php, mysql, js, node.js and all that jazz again if you find bugs please let me know, this is very much a work in progress by a hardware/backend engineer so if you have ideas or advice I welcome it,
